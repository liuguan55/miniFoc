 * typedef RC_FSM_t (*event_cb_t)(void *p2event, void *p2parm)

 * DESCRIPTION
 *    Provides typedef for the event handler functions.
 *
 *    Once the state's normalized event ID and index has been
 *    determined, the associated event call-back is invoked
 *    to effect the state processing and transition.
 *
 * INPUT PARAMETERS
 *    p2event        pointer to the raw event to be processed
 *                   by the event handler.
 *
 *    p2parm         pointer parameter that is simply
 *                   passed through from fsm_engine to each
 *                   event handler.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE
 *    RC_FSM_OK
 *    error otherwise

 * User provided Event Table - one table per state is

 *          possible that a state transition associated with an event 
 *          remain in the current state.
